# lariat
Lariat is a "linked list of arrays". This data structure has the option to insert and erase values just as you would with a vector, but instead of a dynamically resizing array, it adds nodes to the list, and splits/deletes those nodes as values are added/removed. It can insert, erase, index search, find, and compact.
